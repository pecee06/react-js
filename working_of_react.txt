The createRoot method of React creates a virtual DOM (Tree structure)

It uses reconciliation algorithm to differentiate one tree with another (Real DOM with virtual DOM) and changes that part only which has some updates, rather than reloading the entire DOM

Nowadays Fiber has enhanced the entire reconciliation process in following way:

* In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately, it can cause frame drops thus degrading UX. So Fiber make changes in chunks

Features of Fiber:
* Pause work and come back to it lately
* Assign priority to different types of work
* Reuse previous work
* Abort work if no longer needed
