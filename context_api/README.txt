The React Context API helps solve the problem of sharing data between components without having to manually pass props at every level

Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep—without passing it explicitly through props

Context lets a parent component provide data to the entire tree below it

Steps for making a context -
    * Create a context
    * Use that context from the component that needs the data
    * Provide that context from the component that specifies the data
